# knapsack_problem

Here is a study about the Knapsack Problem.
I've implemented different algorithms, including a brute force, a greedy and a genetic algo that I made from scratch, and one other implemented using the pymoo library (also a genetic algo) to solve this problem and I analyse their limits.
